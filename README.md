Set up the GPU Installing necessary library Loading the model Within this the model parameters are defined 
The input image is preprocessed by reshaping the image (28,28) and the data is augmented shifting images to the width direction or the height direction by a fraction between âˆ’0.08 and 0.08 of the total width and then passed to multiple conv layers to get the final prediction.
